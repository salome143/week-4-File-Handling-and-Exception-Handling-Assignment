The program should:
Reads from an existing file.
Modifies its contents (e.g., converts text to uppercase, removes whitespace, or replaces words).
Writes the modified content to a new file.

# File Read & Write Challenge
try:
    # Open the source file in read mode
    with open("input.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.readlines()

    # Modify the content (convert to uppercase)
    modified_content = [line.upper() for line in content]

    # Write to a new file
    with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
        file.writelines(modified_content)

    print("File has been modified and saved as 'output.txt'.")

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file 'input.txt' was not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


Error Handling Lab
The program should:

Ask the user for a filename to open.
Handle errors like file not found or permission issue

# Error Handling Lab
filename = input("Enter the filename: ")

try:
    with open(filename, "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
        print("\nFile Content:\n")
        print(content)

except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: The file '{filename}' does not exist.")
except PermissionError:
    print(f"Error: You don't have permission to read '{filename}'.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
